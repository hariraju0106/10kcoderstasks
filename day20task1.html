            About Department<br></br>
Artificial Intelligence and machine Learning (AI&ML) is a new, emerging field which consists of a set of tools and techniques used to extract useful information from data. AI&ML is a fast growing discipline and is full of rigorous practical analysis. The demand for undergraduates in AI and ML has industry required skills and demand in the Global market over the last few years. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning is also in line demand with computer science. Machine learning is an established research discipline. However, recent advances have increased the impact on many areas of society, science, medicine, and everyday life.AI with ML is in demand in the robotics applications, space technology, industry4.0 and many more.AI and ML delivers modern computational systems that demonstrate capabilities of perception, reasoning, learning and action that are typical of human intelligence.

B.Tech. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning programme emerging area is start, in our College, from the academic year 2021– 22 with a vision to emerge as a premier center for education and research in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and in transforming students into innovative professionals of contemporary and future technologies to cater the global needs of human resources.
